New™ updated instructions:
1. clone this repo
2. make a file called "repos.json"
3. rename `frii_update_example.ini` to `frii_update.ini` and fill in the values
4. in repos.json, put a nested list of `["path/to/cloned/repo",colour integer]`. You will need one of these lists for each repo you want to track
5. install the dependencies (you can do this with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
6. run the bot
7. send `.start` in a channel the bot can see
